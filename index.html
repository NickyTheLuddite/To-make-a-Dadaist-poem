    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.

      const article = `Ms Bray said the department had partnered with Relationships Australia SA and Aboriginal Family Support Services to provide family group conferences to address unborn child concerns.

"Reports made about unborn infants that identify risk provide opportunity to intervene early with the family including referring them for a family group conference, undertaking pre and post birth planning, having ongoing contact with the expectant mother and linking the family to other support agencies," she said.

"The family group conference process helps families develop a plan to keep the child safe; a plan that is led and supported by family.

"If risk factors are unable to be addressed and it is assessed that a newborn will be in danger, DCP develops a planned response after birth."

Ms Bray said if it was determined that a baby needed to be removed at birth, the department would place them with a carer.

"The baby may be able to be safely returned to its parent(s) once the issues have been addressed," she said.

Hospital staff 'uncomfortable' with baby removals

SA Health's acting chief child protection officer Heather Baron said the practice of removing a newborn baby at a birthing hospital wasn't "necessarily always best practice", adding staff felt "uncomfortable" when it occurred. 

"I think from a health point of view, we would probably prefer those removals not to happen in a birthing hospital," she said in November, during an earlier public hearing for Ms Lawrie's inquiry.
